# MonsterChase

Port of an old monster chasing game from Atari 800 and further modifications as part of taking up the challenges of the game!

This code is part of my blog post [Monster hunting like in 1985](https://ntsakonas.github.io/2020/11/22/Monster-hunting-like-in-1985.html)

## Background
I happened to have played this game when I wasa kid, and I came across the original listing from the book
_Stimulating Simulations, 2nd Edition, by C.W.Engel (c) 1979_ and 
can be found in [acrhive.org](https://archive.org/details/ataribooks-stimulating-simulations-atari-version/) and the game is called "Monster Chase" (pages 24-26).


You are locked in a cage with a hungry monster who has life span of 10 turns. The movements take place on a 5x5 grid. 
You can move east,west, south and north by entering E,W,S,N or O to remain in the same place. The monster can also move diagonally.

The goal of the game is to remain alive after 10 turns!

## Evolution

The first step is to port the program to Java and play!
Next, is taking up the challenges from the book!
